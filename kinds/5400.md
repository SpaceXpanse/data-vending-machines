description: Job request to count matching events
---

# Input

The input MUST be a JSON-encoded list of filters as specified in NIP 01.

# Output

`content` MUST contain a stringified number representing the final count. DVMs MAY return partial results using kind 7000 in the same format.

# Params

* `relay`: a relay url to include in the count (required, client MAY provide more than one relay)

# How clients can use this

Clients may want to avoid downloading large datasets from many relays simply in order to de-duplicate and count them. This can be useful for a number of things:

- Counting pubkey followers and other social graph analysis like web of trust score calculation
- Retrieving counts for list pages (number of messages in a conversation, number of lists on a profile)
- Getting metadata for tags (this topic has been used x times)

# Example

#### Request
```json
{
    "content": "[{\"#t\":[\"zapathon\"]}]",
    "kind": 5400,
    "tags": []
}
```

#### Response
```json
{
    "kind": 6400,
    "content": "129469"
}
```
